                                    <p>A <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong> is an essential tool for trainers who want to create balanced and effective teams for battles. Our <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong> allows you to select from hundreds of Pokemon, analyze type matchups, and identify potential weaknesses in your team composition. Using a <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong> helps you make strategic decisions before entering competitions or gym battles, giving you a significant advantage over trainers who build teams without proper analysis.</p>

                                    <h4 class="h5">How do I start building my first team with the Pokemon Team Builder?</h4>
                                    <p>Getting started with our <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong> is simple. First, browse or search for Pokemon in the selection panel on the left side of the screen. Click on a Pokemon card to add it to your team. The <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong> allows you to add up to six Pokemon, the standard team size in most Pokemon games. As you add Pokemon, the Type Analysis section automatically updates to show your team's strengths and weaknesses. This real-time feedback is what makes our <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong> so valuable for strategic team planning.</p>

                                    <h4 class="h5">How does the Type Analysis in the Pokemon Team Builder work?</h4>
                                    <p>The Type Analysis feature in our <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong> is one of its most powerful components. When you add Pokemon to your team, the <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong> calculates type effectiveness based on each Pokemon's type(s). The analysis shows which types your team is strong against (super effective), weak against (not very effective), and particularly vulnerable to (double weakness). This comprehensive analysis helps you identify and address potential weaknesses in your team composition, which is crucial for competitive play. The <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong>'s type analysis considers dual-typing and provides a clear visual representation of your team's defensive profile.</p>

The <strong>Pokemon Team Builder</strong>'s type analysis makes this process intuitive, highlighting potential vulnerabilities that might otherwise go unnoticed.</p>
